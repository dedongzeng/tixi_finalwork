# ResNet with TF 2.0

ResNet34 implement with TF 2.0, input with CIFAR-100 (32x32) dataset.
Layer topology refers to: <https://github.com/apache/singa/blob/master/examples/cnn/model/resnet.py>

TF 2.0 is installed from the IBM channel, with TF-LMS support. 
TF-LMS is built into the tensorflow-gpu conda package so it is installed by default when you install the GPU enabled TensorFlow from the WML CE channel.

More details about this channel, please refer to: <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5SF7_1.7.0/navigation/wmlce_install.htm>.
